
Simple way : 
Take Trex or Monkey game..Both games move in x direction. Hence fix the camera.position.x on the player.x value
(eg) camera.position.x = trex.x
Also if you want your game to move with your trex in y direction, assign y position also. 
(eg) camera.position.y = trex.y. 
Else you can have camera.position.y = height/2.

Adjust your ground reseting.. restart, gameOver buttons can be repositioned using camera.position.x values instead of absolute/definite values that you were using.
