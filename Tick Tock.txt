Additional hints : (Refer Project document for other hints)

1. To draw the clock at the center and to make the coding easy, translate to 200,200 position of the canvas.
2. Be aware that the y-axis increases in the downward direction, therefore angles are measured clockwise from the positive x-direction ("3 o'clock").
Thats why, you need to give rotate(-90) to make it work from 12 o'clock.

3. Use map function to map the hours/minutes/seconds to angle for drawing them.
scAngle = map(sc, 0, 60, 0, 360);
mnAngle = map(mn,0,60,0,360)
hrAngle = map(hr % 12,0,12,0,360)

4. Drawing seconds hand
//drawing seconds hand
    push();
    rotate(scAngle); //rotate the hand based on angle calculated
    stroke(255,0,0);
    strokeWeight(7);
    line(0,0,100,0);
    pop()

similarly draw hours and minutes angle.

5. To draw the arc of seconds (https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/arc - refer document to understand how it works)
//Seconds
    stroke(255,0,0);
    arc(0,0,300,300,0,scAngle);

Similarly draw arc for hours,minutes as requested in the project document.
