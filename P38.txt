
Simple way : 
Take Trex or Monkey game..Both games move in x direction. Hence fix the camera.position.x on the player.x value
(eg) camera.position.x = trex.x
Also if you want your game to move with your trex in y direction, assign y position also.

Adjust your ground reseting, restart, gameOver buttons can be repositioned using camera.position.x values instead of absolute values that you were using.
