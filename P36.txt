Additional Hints :

Database is going to have

project name
        - Food
        - FeedTime




Display function for Food.js is given in project pdf.

No need to have updateFoodStock, getFedTime, getFoodStock in Food.js

In sketch.js, create a new foodObject. And call display function of it.

When you read the foodStock from database, set the foodStock property of foodObject.
function readStock(data){
  foodS=data.val();
  foodObj.foodStock = foodS;
}


When Add Food button is pressed, increase the food by 1 and update DB with the new foodS value.
(foodS = foodS + 1)

When feedDog button is pressed, dog should have happy dog image.
Decrease the foodStock in foodObject by 1.
Update the Food and FeedTime to DB.

//function to update food stock and last fed time

function feedDog(){
  dog.addImage(happyDog);

  foodObj.foodStock = foodObj.foodStock - 1;
  database.ref('/').update({
    Food:foodObj.foodStock,
    FeedTime:hour()
  })
}

To display the feed time

 fill(255,255,254);
  textSize(15);
  if(lastFed>=12){
    text("Last Feed : "+ lastFed%12 + " PM", 350,30);
   }else if(lastFed==0){
     text("Last Feed : 12 AM",350,30);
   }else{
     text("Last Feed : "+ lastFed + " AM", 350,30);
   }
