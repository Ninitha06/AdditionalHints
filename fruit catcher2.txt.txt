ADDITIONAL HINTS : THESE ARE ADDITIONAL HINTS, PLEASE REFER MAIN PROJECT DOCUMENT FOR OTHER HINTS AND STEPS TO FOLLOW. ALSO REFER THIS ONLY IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO PROCEED WITH PROJECT..IT IS ALWAYS APPRECIABLE IF YOU CAN TRY ON YOUR OWN.


1. Check if allPlayers is present, only then proceed to x,y,i value setting. (Check class code).
2. In play function, Outside the for loop, use allPlayers.player1.score to get the indivdual scores and display using text command.
(In last fruitcatcher1, I have mentioned how to update score of players).


Below is additional activity. not required for project submission. 

1. Change gameState to 2 when any of their score reaches 10(your wish) in play function.
2. in sketch.js, gameState should change to 1 only if playerCount is 2 and gameState is 0. if gameState is 2, call end()
and update gameState in DB as 2.


3. End function to show who wins

end(){
       console.log("Game Ended");
       form.hide();
       Player.getPlayerInfo();
       textSize(35);
       fill("red");
       if(allPlayers){
       if(allPlayers.player1.score > allPlayers.player2.score)
        text(allPlayers.player1.name + " wins", 400,200);
        else
            text(allPlayers.player2.name + " wins", 400,200);
       }
    }
