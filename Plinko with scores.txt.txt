Debugging project. 

We learnt about different errors and how to debug them.
So first go through the code and try to understand what they are trying to code.


Hints if unable to proceed :
1. count and turn are same.. use any 1, not both..
2. it is particle variable...not particles..
3. use text command to display the scores near the divisions.
4. use line command to draw the yellow line.. stroke("yellow") will give yellow color.
5. gameStates should be start and end. if gameState is end, display Game Over.
